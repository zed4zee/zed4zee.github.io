    "text": "Greetings!\nThis is my first post on this site and I always tend to romanticize this shit!\nI have created websites and blogs earlier but here I am again stuck with what to put here. Oh! Here is an idea— “I can write a little bit about the purpose and background of this blog.” Yeah that seems like a good one. It will help me think about it as well because I have no clear clue of why I am doing this at all in the first place!\nIn case you are wondering if this is all satire, then I must say that it is not! That is how I write. I sit in front of the keyboard, write whatever comes to my mind, and edit stuff.\nSo, let me walk you through why I created this, and in the process think about it! Ok?!"

I know that all of this will help me in the future in some way or the other.\nThe others bit is with uncertainty. It depends on others. I will leave it to them.\nIn case you missed it, you are one of the others. Satire stuff…ehem ehem!\nSo to summarize, this blog serves as a multi-purpose personal web space, where I plan to document and share all sorts of wonderful things as I go through the voyage of my life. Having this personal web space would enable me to capture meaningful moments from my life and store it for myself and for others who find them useful. Insights from the books I read, movies I watch, courses I take, trips I took, skills I learned, projects I have started, etc.\nLet us move ahead."

Everyone, including you and me, has a story to narrate, an experience to share, words to speak, knowledge to elucidate, or skills to show. Yet for most of us, it remains hidden in our hearts. As we grow old, all the unnarrated stories, unshared experiences, unspoken words, and unelucidated knowledge and skills remain hidden! Each of which has the potential to inspire, teach, and help others."

At this point, all I can do is redirect you to the people who have encouraged me in this business of documenting and sharing."

In their deep learning course, they advised us to create a blog and document our learning journey. One of the pieces of advice is here. I created a blog a few months ago as part of documenting my deep learning journey.\nAnother person who encouraged me was Austin Kleon through his book Show Your Work. Just read that book, please!"

    "text": "Taking It Up Another Notch\nA few weeks ago I thought of generalizing the advice given by Jeremy & Rachel and trying to see if I can apply it across other areas of my life as well apart from deep learning. And here we are!\nWhen this idea occurred to me, I had a lil’ chat with one of the fast.ai students with whom I was in touch. Amazing guy! I remember telling him that going through this complete process of actually writing and finishing a blog post about something is far far better than some random idea that stays in the mind. Even if we begin writing it on a document, there is a high chance that it will stay unfinished. It is only if we take the responsibility of putting it on the internet for the world to see we polish it and in the process think about it deeply."

I didn’t write much though but it was a good learning experience when it comes to creating websites and publishing them.\nIn my mind, psychologically, when I think of that blog, I do feel proud of myself but it is like this “student exercise” thingy of the past, something just for deep learning or the fast.ai course. I am not able to make my mind think beyond it. If I could, then I would have worked on that itself instead of creating this new thing and struggling to write my first post here. Psychological bs is a bitch!\nI am still on my way to finish the course. I have decided to document about that here from now on."

On one hand, there are writing platforms like Medium and Quora, and on the other hand, there are social media platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and so on.\nTo keep my vanity in check, I don’t use any of them for sharing my work. It is very easy for me to get bothered about various metrics like “the number of followers” and “likes”. At this stage at least I am not someone who can handle all this stuff. I know people who genuinely don’t get affected by these things. I am not one of them, at least not now. Moreover, the reasons why I am doing all this has got nothing to do with making big on the internet or becoming a content creator.\nI want to be comfortable in my own space away from the chaos and at the same time express myself. A personal blog seems like the best go-to option."

I could have created separate places for each category to organize- one section for notes, one section for ideas, one section for projects, and so on. But it doesn’t seem like a good idea. There will be a gazillion sections. Instead, I want to keep it simple.\nMoreover, a reader can filter out relevant posts amidst the mess based on the categories. For each post I can add a tag, describing the nature of a post or its topic. If a post is a musing, I will add the tag musing to it, if a post is centered around history, I will add the tag history, and so on. This shall fix the organization issue and help the reader navigate easily."

My younger self did start something of this sort(so maybe I would tell him to stay consistent with it).\nWhen I was 13, I was passionate about singing and had an immense love for Nasheeds. I remember creating and publishing a website back then, sharing my aspirations and goals around singing. What would you expect from a teenager who has got his hands on the internet?!\nAs for my past life, what is done is done! All I plan to do is recollect some stuff from my memory and try to archive it here. It won’t be fresh but whatever. As for my current ongoing life, I can start doing this now!"
