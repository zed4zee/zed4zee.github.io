## The Chilling Shrill Of Regret

If only I had taken *complete* charge of my life, I would have been in a totally different place today.

Atleast I don't want to say this a few months or years from now. Self accountability is vital. 

## The Light At The End Of The Tunnel

I can turn all this around. I just need to sort some stuff out. Let us strap-in and do this baby!

## I Know What I Want

After a lot of trials and errors, I now have a very clear picture of the things I want to do in life. I felt lost once I no longer am now.

## Get Disciplined About The Right Things In Life

That is the essential key to freedom. Figure out what the *right things* are stick with it.

## Tenacity & Perseverance

Keep Getting Up If You Fall Down

## Love & Forgive Yourself

It is Ok dear!
